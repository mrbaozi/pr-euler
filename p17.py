# This really isn't a programming problem, I just put it in for completeness' sake

a = 10*(3*5 + 4*6 + 1*7) + 8*36 + 70 + 36 # numbers 1-99
b = 9*10*99 # nine times "hundred and" (10 letters) from 1 to 99
c = 9*a # numbers 1-99 appear 9 times (<100)
d = 36*100 # numbers 1-9, 100 times each
e = 7*9 # 9 times "hundred" (whole hundreds)
f = 11 # one thousand

print(a+b+c+d+e+f)
